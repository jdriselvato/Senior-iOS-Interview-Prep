// Merge One Sorted Array Into Another

/*First array has n positive numbers, and they are sorted in the non-descending order.

Second array has 2n numbers: first n are also positive and sorted in the same way but the last n are all zeroes.

Merge the first array into the second and return the latter. You should get 2n positive integers sorted in the non-descending order.

Example:

{
"first": [1, 3, 5],
"second": [2, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]
}

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Notes

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
1 <= array elements (except those zeroes) <= 2 * 109
You can use only constant auxiliary space
*/

// Try it this time without combining the array since the data is already split

func merge_one_into_another(first: [Int], second: [Int]) -> [Int] {
        
    return []
}
