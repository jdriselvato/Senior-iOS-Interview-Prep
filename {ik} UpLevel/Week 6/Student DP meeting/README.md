# 790. Domino and Tromino Tiling

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/

> You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.

> Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

> In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

class Solution {
    func numTilings(_ n: Int) -> Int {
        
    }
